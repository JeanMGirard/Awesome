Metrics \u00b6 Lead Time Lead time measures how long it takes for a change to occur. Measuring the average time it takes for a concept to go from an idea to implementation is an effective metric for evaluating workflow and productivity. Reduced lead times indicate that your DevOps team is adaptive, productive, and capable of addressing feedback promptly. Deployment Frequency Deployment frequency denotes how often new features or capabilities are launched. Frequency can be measured on a daily or weekly basis. Many organizations prefer to track deployments daily, especially as they improve efficiency. Deployment Time How long does it take to roll out deployments once they\u2019ve been approved? Change Volume Deployment frequency means little if the majority of deployments are of little consequence. Failed Deployment Rate Sometimes referred to as the mean time to failure, this metric determines how often deployments prompt outages or other issues. Change Failure Rate The change failure rate refers to the extent to which releases lead to unexpected outages or other unplanned failures. Time to Detection A low change failure rate doesn\u2019t always indicate that all is well with your application. Mean Time to Recovery (MTRR) - Once failed deployments or changes are detected, how long does it take actually to address the problem and get back on track? Defect Escape Rate Every software deployment runs the risk of sparking new defects. These might not be discovered until acceptance testing is completed. Worse yet, they could be found by the end user. Defect Volume This metric relates to the escape rate highlighted above, but instead focuses on the actual volume of defects. While some defects are to be expected, sudden increases should spark concern. A high volume of defects for a particular application may indicate issues with development or test data management. Availability Availability highlights the extent of downtime for a given application. Unplanned Work How much time is dedicated to unexpected efforts? The unplanned work rate (UWR) tracks this in relation to time spent on planned work. Ideally, the unplanned work rate (UWR) will not exceed 25 percent. Cycle Time Cycle time metrics provide a broad overview of application deployment.
