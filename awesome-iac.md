### Tools

### Testing

- [kitchen](https://kitchen.ci/)
    - [Kitchen-Terraform](https://github.com/newcontext-oss/kitchen-terraform) Kitchen-Terraform provides a set of Test Kitchen plugins which enable the use of Test Kitchen to converge a Terraform configuration and verify the resulting infrastructure systems with InSpec controls.
- [rspec](https://rspec.info/)
    - [rspec-terraform)](https://github.com/bsnape/rspec-terraform)
- [InSpec](https://github.com/inspec/inspec) Chef InSpec is an open-source testing framework for infrastructure with a human- and machine-readable language for specifying compliance, security and policy requirements.
- [Goss](https://github.com/goss-org/goss) Goss is a YAML based serverspec alternative tool for validating a server‚Äôs configuration. It eases the process of writing tests by allowing the user to generate tests from the current system state. Once the test suite is written they can be executed, waited-on, or served as a health endpoint.
- [driftctl](https://driftctl.com/) driftctl is a free and open-source CLI that warns of infrastructure drift and fills in the missing piece in your DevSecOps toolbox.
