## Terms

### Software development

- **Encapsulation**: functions hide their implementation and only expose their signature.
- **Simplicity**: functions have a single responsibility and don't mix nouns with verbs, which makes them fundamentally untangled.
- **Stateless**: functions are just code; they don't contain state or instance.
- **Purity**: functions can be pure (i.e. have no side-effects) which makes them easy to understand, reuse, test and parallelise.
- **[SOLID](#solid)**
- **DCI**
- **DDD**
- **SOA**
- ***Architectures***
